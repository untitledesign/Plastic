        as I look around<br>
        around this big round
        <br><br>
        all this plastic in the ground<br>
        all this plastic around
        <br><br>
        and you may find yourself frown<br>
        when all you see when you look around<br>
        is just plastic in the ground<br>
        all this plastic in a mound
        <br><br>
        and as I look around this round<br>
        I see Moses people frown
        <br><br>
        a generation born to early for new wealth<br>
        but too late for new land<br>
        something so unnatural has to be made by man
        <br><br>
        look inside a personâ€™s body<br>
        look inside a fish
        <br><br>
        what have you found?
        <br><br>
        the same thing we put in the ground<br>
        its just plastic all around
        <br><br>
        all this plastic around<br>
        all this plastic in the ground<br>
        all this plastic around
        <br><br>
        and you may find yourself frown<br>
        when all you see when you look around<br>
        is just plastic in the ground<br>
        plastic all around
